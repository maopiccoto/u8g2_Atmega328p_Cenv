## What's this?
This repositroy contains the main.c file coded in Atmel Studio 7 for the implementation of the example sketch "GraphicTest" in u8g2 repository https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2 created by Oliver Kraus.

This particular implementation is ATmega328p @8Mhz(No Crystal) and Nokia5110 based.

Because I found migrating projects from arduino to AS7 can optimize flash and RAM usage, apart from other benefits...and is cool :-)

## About Atmel Studio
Don't forget import files in folder /csrc to your AS7 project
